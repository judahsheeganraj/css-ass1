     <h3><i>What is CSS ? </i></h3>
     <ol>
        <li>CSS stands for cascading style sheet</li>
        <br>
        <li>CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen,paper,or in other media.</li>
        <br>
        <li> <span class="three">Css is not necessary</span><span class="four">CSS saves a list of work</span>It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once</li>
        <br>
        <li class="five">External stylesheets are stored in CSS file</li>
        </ol>
    
        <br>
        <br>
        <h2 style="color: red;">CSS can be added to HTML document in 3 ways</h2>

     <ul class="six">
         <li>Inline - by using a style attribute inside HTML elements1</li>
         <br>
         <li>Internal - by using a style element in the head section</li>
         <br>
         <li>External - by using a link elements to link to an external CSS file.</li>
         <br>
         <li>The Most common way to add CSS , is to keep the style in external CSS files . However. <span class="seven"> in this tutorial we will use inline and internal  styles</span> , because this is easier to demonstrate , and easier for you to try it yourself.</li>
     </ul>   
     <span class="nine">
     <p>When comparing CSS class vs ID , the difference is that CSS class applies a style to multiple elements . ID, on the other hand applies a style to one unique element.ID is also special in that you can use a special URL to link directly to an element and it's used by JavaScript</p>
     <p>In CSS ,selectors are used to target a specific element or range of elements on a web page . Once an element has been targeted , a style or set of styles can be applied to theelement.</p>
     <p>There is awide range of selectors available . Two ofthe most commonly used are class and ID. Both are used to target elements to which a style should be applied</p>
